# First-GAN
In this notebook, we are going to create generative adversarial network (GAN) Specifically, we ill build and train a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9). we will be using PyTorch in this specialization, so if you're not familiar with this framework, you may find the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) useful. The hints will also often include links to relevant documentation.

### Learning Objectives
1.   Build the generator and discriminator components of a GAN from scratch.
2.   Create generator and discriminator loss functions.
3.   Train your GAN and visualize the generated images.
